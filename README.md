# TileEditor
A simple tilemap editor program. It is intended to be used as a tool for developing game levels. It aims
 to export tilemap data files which can be read by other programs to project their data into a game world. For
 example, to create terrain by projecting each tile as a quad in 3D space, at their given elevation.

Currently only 32*32 tilemap grids are supported.

Written in C++ using SDL2.
